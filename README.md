# UK E-Commerce Sales Dashboard

## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing a one-year sales transaction dataset from a UK-based e-commerce business that specializes in gifts and homewares. Using Tableau, I developed an interactive dashboard to uncover trends, monitor sales performance, and provide actionable insights for business decision-making.

The dashboard enables stakeholders to explore sales patterns across various dimensions, such as products, customers, and countries, while providing a comprehensive view of the e-commerce business's operations.

### Project Goals

- Analyze Sales Performance: Identify top-performing products, sales trends, and customer purchase behavior.
- Monitor Order Cancellations: Understand the impact of cancellations and their relation to inventory management.
- Provide Actionable Insights: Empower stakeholders to make data-driven decisions to improve revenue and reduce cancellations.

### Dataset Information

The dataset contains 500,000 rows and 8 columns of sales transactions. Below is an overview of the key features:

- TransactionNo: A six-digit unique number defining each transaction. A "C" indicates cancellation.
- Date: The date of the transaction.
- ProductNo: A unique identifier for each product.
- Product: Name of the product/item sold.
- Price: Price per unit of the product (in GBP).
- Quantity: Number of units sold (negative values indicate cancellations).CustomerNo: A unique identifier for each customer.
